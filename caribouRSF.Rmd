# Overview

From the ECCC 2011:

6.2.4 Taiga Plains
Several coefficients had confounding effects when modelled together in the Taiga Plains
ecozone model. Due to these issues, peatlands and NDVI were not included in the model. In
general, caribou selected for moderate elevations of ~620 m, as well as intermediate values of
ruggedness and for herbaceous landcover types in relationship to the constant (Table 46).
Caribou exhibited avoidance of high road density (Figure 45), deciduous, shrub and water
landcover types. In contrast to the other ecozone models, caribou in Taiga Plains avoided both
recent and old burns (Figure 47). However, the Taiga Plains model poorly predicted withheld
caribou locations (rs = 0.13) and also had relatively low model accuracy (ROC = 0.60) and a
low pseudo R2 (Table 44, 45).

Table 46. Estimates of caribou selectivity (Î²) coefficients and standard errors (SE) at the ecozone level from generalized linear mixed models with
a random intercept for individual caribou. Boreal woodland caribou telemetry datasets were collected across Canada between 2000 and 2010 by
provinces and territories. Positive selectivity coefficients indicate selection for that covariate and negative selectivity coefficients indicate
avoidance. Squared terms (such as elevation2) indicate that the relationship was quadratic (i.e., caribou selected for intermediate elevations).
